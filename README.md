# Usage

Research "Underground Transport", this is behing ConveyorT2

When the research is unlocked, the three Entrances are available in the "Transports" toolbar.

Place the Entrances on the map, instances of the same type will autoconnect when placed correctly and within limits.

Initially the Entrance is dual Input/Output.
The Input/Output status gets fixed when a transport/building/storage is connected to the Entrance.

When selecting the Entrance, the connection and status is shown.

When Entrances are not connected and a valid one to connect is available, you can use the "Connect button" in the UI

The connection is valid when : 

- Entrances are of the same type

- The horizontal distance is 70 or less

- The vertical distance is 30 or less.

The Underground Transport uses the speed of the in and outgoing ports.
The time it takes for the products to travel thru the underground traject is identical to a Level 3 Conveyor/Pipe
